I am a master student at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT). I am interested in geometry, algebra, combinatorics, and algorithms. My current projects are related to Coxeter polytopes in hyperbolic spaces. Besides the research activity, I also teach at MIPT. In particular, this semester I teach differential topology, algebraic topology, and mathematical logic.

In 2017, I graduated from school No. 33 with in-depth study of mathematics in Yaroslavl, Russia. In high school, I was mainly interested in competitive programming <span style="white-space: nowrap;">( <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/Cyanprism"><img src="{{ '/assets/codeforces_logo.png' | relative_url }}" width="20px" style="vertical-align: sub;"> <span class="username">cyanprism</span></a> ).</span> In 2016 and 2017, I was a prize-winner of the All-Russian School Olympiad in Informatics. Later I was an active participant of the ICPC.
