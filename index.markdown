I am a master of Computer Science and Computer Engineering. I am interested in geometry, topology, algebra, logic, number theory, combinatorics, and algorithms. My current projects are related to hyperbolic reflective lattices, arithmetic groups, and hyperbolic knot theory. Besides the research activity, I also taught at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT). In particular, last semester I taught differential topology, algebraic topology, and mathematical logic.

In 2017, I graduated from school No. 33 with in-depth study of mathematics in Yaroslavl, Russia. In high school, I was mainly interested in competitive programming <span style="white-space: nowrap;">( <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/Cyanprism"><img src="{{ '/assets/codeforces_logo.png' | relative_url }}" width="20px" style="vertical-align: sub;"> <span class="username">cyanprism</span></a> ).</span> In 2016 and 2017, I was a prize-winner of the All-Russian School Olympiad in Informatics. Later I was an active participant of the ICPC.

At the university, I began to be interested in algebra and discrete mathematics, and later in geometry and topology. My bachelor's degree is poblushed in [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.](https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/0000-000-00/S0002-9947-2023-08967-X/?active=current). In 2023, I completed my master's degree under the supervision of prof. [Nikolay V. Bogachev](https://nvbogachev.netlify.app). My master's thesis is available [here](https://cyanprism.github.io/masters_thesis.pdf).
